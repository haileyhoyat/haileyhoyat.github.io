                Since November 2021 I have been involved with the open source City Scrapers project from City Bureau and currently help manage the project which consists of (9) code repositories and ~200 scrapers. 
                City Scrapers supports the Documenters program by scraping websites for public meeting information. <br><br>
                In August 2022 I was responsible for the initial scraper builds for the Fresno, California Documenters program.
                This entailed building out (30) scrapers and bringing the repository's open issues down from (36) to (3) within our inital (2) month deadline.<br><br>
                In February 2023 I was responsible for the repository setup and initial scraper builds for the Dallas and Philadelphia Documenters programs.<br><br> 
                
                In addition I engage with community contributors, lead Build Nights, and respond to open issues from various Documenters programs.
